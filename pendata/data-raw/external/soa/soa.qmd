# Society of Actuaries Data

`pendata` includes selected SOA mortality rates and mortality improvement rates.

See the programs `SOA Pub.H-2010 Headcount-Weighted Mortality Rates.R` and `SOA MP-2018_mortality_improvement_table.R` in the data-raw/soa folder. The programs are independent of each other so the order in which they are run does not matter.

## Mortality Rates

`pendata` includes Pub.H-2010 Headcount-Weighted Mortality Rates for general, safety, and teacher employees (`SOA Pub.H-2010 Headcount-Weighted Mortality Rates.R`).

-   [Pub-2010 landing page](https://www.soa.org/resources/research-reports/2019/pub-2010-retirement-plans/)

-   [Pub-2010 Public Retirement Plans Mortality Tables Report](https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/resources/research-report/2019/pub-2010-mort-report.pdf)

-   [Pub.H-2010 Headcount-Weighted Mortality Rates (pub-2010-headcount-mort-rates.xlsx)](https://www.soa.org/49347a/globalassets/assets/files/resources/research-report/2019/pub-2010-headcount-mort-rates.xlsx) spreadsheet used by Reason, which has mortality rates for general, safety, and teacher workers as of 2010.

## Mortality Improvement Scales

`pendata` includes SOA Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2018.

-   SOA Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2018 [landing page](https://www.soa.org/resources/experience-studies/2018/mortality-improvement-scale-mp-2018/)

-   [SOA Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2018 report](https://www.soa.org/49964f/globalassets/assets/files/resources/experience-studies/2018/mortality-improvement-scale-mp-2018.pdf)

-   SOA Scale MP-2018 Rates ([mortality-improvement-scale-mp-2018-rates.xlsx](https://www.soa.org/493456/globalassets/assets/files/resources/experience-studies/2018/mortality-improvement-scale-mp-2018-rates.xlsx))

Mortality improvement steps (`SOA_mp-2018_mortality_improvement_table.R`):

-   Download from SOA site

-   Read male and female tables, create a long data frame

-   Save as an .rda file. pendata saves the unadjusted mortality improvement table because other systems may also use mp-2018 and we want a version as provided by SOA for use when developing data for individuals pension systems.
