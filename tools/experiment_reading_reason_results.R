#. prepare class names and dataframe names ---------------------------------

#  but used senior_management in dataframe names

#. unpack the data -------

# get one big list of lists of data frames
# outer list has 7 lists, one for each class
# each inner list has 4 data frames
#   wf_active_df, term, refund, retire
# they are similar but not the same in structure, but the same structure for each class
