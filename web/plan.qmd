# Preliminary plan for generalizing the Reason FRS Model

-   DONE - Modify FRS to make sure it runs on Windows (change number of cores)
-   DONE - Save ALL Reason results from baseline run
-   DONE - Establish initial tests to see whether the model as modified reproduces Reason baseline results

-   Separate functions from action -- make sure that all sourced files before running the model are functions. Then load constants and let functions do the action.
    -   DONE - Separate "Florida FRS benefit model.R" into separate files for functions and actions
    -   DONE - Separate "Florida FRS funding model.R" into separate files for functions and actions
-   Isolate constants
-   Localize all functions - make sure all data used in functions is passed in as arguments
-   Modularize - break large functions into smaller pieces
-   Restructure data to be generalizable - e.g., stacked data frames in a common format
