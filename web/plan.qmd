# Preliminary plan for generalizing the Reason FRS Model

-   Modify FRS to make sure it runs on Windows (change number of cores)
-   Save ALL Reason results from baseline run
-   Establish tests to see whether the model as modified reproduces Reason baseline results
-   Separate functions from action -- make sure that all sourced files are only functions or constants. Let functions do the action.
-   Isolate constants
-   Localize all functions - make sure all data used in functions is passed in as arguments
-   Modularize - break large functions into smaller pieces
-   Restructure data to be generalizable - e.g., stacked data frames in a common format
